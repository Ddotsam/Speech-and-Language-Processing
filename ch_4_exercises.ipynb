Alexa responds quickly to my commands and helps me with daily tasks, from playing music to controlling my smart devices. Additionally, its design is sleek and easy to integrate into any room. The seller was very quick with shipping, and the product arrived in perfect condition. I will definitely recommend both the product and the seller! Thank you for a great shopping experience.\",\n",

It is just a mediocre light. But, the fact that I got both at $22 is the most fantastic steal. Would definitely recommend!\",\n",

However, I do love the new lightbulb. My son thinks it’s great that we can change the colors of the lightbulb, I also love that it is adjustable to different levels depending on the needed brightness. As always, I love my Alexa echo and have synced them throughout the house. The speaker is amazing and Alexa is receptive to voice commands at all times. Even my toddler loves to talk to Alexa! I have an Alexa in almost every room at this point, and I’m not sure how we lived without her before! The combination of the echo and the lightbulb is perfect and I am so glad I was able to get both of these products for a great price.\",\n",

One w a clock display & one without a clock displace. Name them something different ?! Now I'm suck with one I dont want. Frankly that's pretty stupid.\",\n",

Assumed these more expensive and newer models would work at least as well. They do not! Have tried adjusting the sensitivity and distance settings to no avail. Rarely does the Echo Dot detect my motion to trigger my routines although sometimes the cat triggers it in the middle of the night. Extremely frustrating and disappointing.\",\n",
